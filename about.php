						<h2>Frequently Asked questions</h2>
					
						<h3>What kind of results can I expect?</h3>

						<p>You can expect to become stronger, more fit and toned while dropping inches and pounds. On average you'll drop 3-6 pounds, 1-2 dress sizes, and 2-5% body fat every 30 days. This proven program uses a combination of weight training and boxing to scorch up to 900 calories, torch body fat, sculpt the entire body, and build lean sexy muscle tone.</p> 

						<h3>What if I am not physically fit?</h3>

						<p>Eze fitness Boot Camp welcomes women and men of all ages, abilities and fitness levels. Each exercise is designed with a progression and regression phase, so whether you are a reluctant newbie or a so called "gym rat," Eze fitness Boot Camp will help you accomplish your specific goal.</p>

						<h3>Okay, I'm getting excited! How often can I attend?</h3>

						<p>The boot camps run six days week, Monday - Saturday, and since they are held in-doors, the weather is never an issue. We suggest that you attend at least three days a week, but you are more than welcome to come kick ass everyday!</p>

						<h3>I wanna start today, what do I need to bring?</h3>

						<p>Nothing! Just showing up for class with a "KICK ASS" attitude is what you need to bring to the table. We'll provide all the equipment, accountability, and motivation you'll need. Just bring a bottle of water, a towel, and come ready to BRING IT! Oh, and make sure NOT to come on an empty stomach. We don't want you passing out during our intense workout!</p>
					
						<h3>I'm Ready, How Much Does It Cost And How Do I Get Started!?</h3>
					
						<p>If you were to work with a personal trainer one-on-one you'd pay at least $550-$900/month. Even if you worked with an average personal trainer you'd easily pay at least $400/month for a training program with no accountability, direction, and motivation. And you'd be lucky to find a personal trainer out there who would put his money where his mouth is and guarantee your results like Eze fitness Boot Camp.</p>
					
						<p>But the good news is that you won't pay anywhere near what the typical trainer charges for one-on-one training. Instead your investment is as low as $47 for the first month, and $150 per month after.</p>
